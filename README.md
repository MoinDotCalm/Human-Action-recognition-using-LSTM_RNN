# Human-Action-recognition-using-LSTM_RNN
With the rapid development of computer vision technology, human action recognition technology has occupied an important position in this field. It has important practical value and research value in security protection, advanced human-computer interaction, video search analysis and sports analysis. Due to the non rigid body characteristics of the human body, the change of illumination, and the influence of the changeable surrounding environment, human action recognition is more challenging. Technology powered by Artificial intelligence is used in various HAR(Human Action recognition) systems.  Our project focuses on building a model that recognises human actions accurately from a given video. This can be used in entertainment, athlete performance analysis, etc.
